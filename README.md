# Program Overview

This is a basic application on which the user may choose a chaos pattern to try, and see how it works.

# Reason

The program is made to recreate the same effect I saw from a youtube video.

I later learned that this is called chaos game and now I'm trying to recreate all that I could see on his channel or anything in the internet.

# Development (In development)

`9/1/24` A note to future me: Make a menu where user can choose the type of pattern they want, and consider the note you made on the previous commit. Goodluck!

`9/2/24-9/4/24` During these days I made a repo (private) to try and learn making GUI (buttons) and a basic layout for my planned application. And this today (`9/4/24`) I will start to implement it here.
