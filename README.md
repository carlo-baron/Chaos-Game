# Program Overview

This is a basic application on which the user may choose a chaos game pattern and see it get generated.

# Reason

I was inspired by a youtube video. I saw the video and thought I could recreate that using code and so I did until it escalated into this.

# Development (In development)

`9/1/24` A note to future me: Make a menu where user can choose the type of pattern they want, and consider the note you made on the previous commit. Goodluck!

`9/2/24-9/4/24` During these days I made a repo (private) to try and learn making GUI (buttons) and a basic layout for my planned application. And this today (`9/4/24`) I will start to implement it here.

`9/9/24` The app is basically done but can be scaled up. I might add design and more patterns in the future.
